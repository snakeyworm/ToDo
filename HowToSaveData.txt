 Data for the user's created list should be saved in this format:

UserList = { name: str, key: str }

<==== AsyncStorage ====>

saved_lists = [ UserList, ... ]
key = value // Where key is hex string and value is actual user list data

On start saved_lists is loaded into the app where it can be passed to HomeList for display of
the user's lists. In order to load in actual list data use the key property of UserList which
corresponds to the key in AsyncStorage. The current list should be saved in the state of the App
as a UserList
